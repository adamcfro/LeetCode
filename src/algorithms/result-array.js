/**
 * You are given a 1-indexed array of distinct integers nums of length n where
 * you need to distribute all the elements of nums between two arrays arr1 and
 * arr2 using n operations. In the first operation, append nums[1] to arr1. In
 * the second operation, append nums[2] to arr2. Afterwards, in the ith
 * operation:
 *   â€¢ If the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2,
 *     append nums[i] to arr1. Otherwise, append nums[i] to arr2.
 * The array result is formed by concatenating the arrays arr1 and arr2. For
 * example, if arr1 == [1,2,3] and arr2 == [4,5,6], then result = [1,2,3,4,5,6].
 *
 * Return the array result.
 *
 * @format
 * @param {number[]} nums - An array of positive numbers
 * @returns {number[]} - Returns an array after performing operations
